Walking into old friends
Can't find common ground
Staring at the pavement or
Nervously nose about
Limited to stories
With nostalgia written on
Running 30 miles an hour
While they still linger on

Sissy finally moved to the city
Sissy finally moved in to town
Sissy finally moved to the city
It's about time I show Sissy around

Last time I saw you
I didn't feel so strange
Something about you
Totally changed
You'll know
If you grew up in a village
Anything goes but
Everybody knows,

Sissy finally moved to the city
Sissy finally moved in to town
Sissy finally moved to the city
It's about time I show Sissy around, ooh

Sissy finally moved to the city
Sissy finally moved in to town
Sissy finally moved to the city
It's about time I show Sissy around, ooh

I heard they found the old man,
Who was living by the tracks
Partly eaten by his dogs,
Which they found chewing on his legs
You know if you grew up in a village

You gotta,
Wave back, when they're waving at ya
Wear a smile in the Summer weather
Wave back, when they're waving at ya
Wear a smile in the Summer weather

Sissy finally moved to the city
Sissy finally moved in to town, ooh
Sissy finally moved to the city
It's about time I show Sissy,
What I'm all about...

Wave back, when they're waving at ya
Wear a smile in the Summer weather
Wave back, when they're waving at ya
Wear a smile in the Summer weather

(Repeat until hypnotized)
