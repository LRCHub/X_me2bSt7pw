Before I had you committed
To my memory
Before I had you clinging
To my purse

Back when all those pills
They'd had seemed friendly
When you claimed to be
A registered nurse

I thought i lived in such a state
I was a crawling, faggot retrobate
You gave me the finest high-heeled shoes
I'd ever worn

Oh Girl, I can't do what you girls do
And still be a lady!
Girl, I can't sell it like you do.
At 5 0'clock I just receded to the shadows
It's a young mans job and i know I'm nothing new

All I need is 25
To get me out of here alive
All I need is a ticket
To take me home

I thought i lived in such a state
I was a crawling, faggot retrobate
You gave me the finest high-heeled shoes
I'd ever worn
